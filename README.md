# NextUp-Public

[NextUp](http://cydia.saurik.com/package/se.nosskirneh.nextup/) is a nice little enhancement that allows you to glimpse ahead of the current track and even change it if you don't like the what the future had in store for you.

Don’t like a song? Skip it before it has even started playing.

It’s especially useful for those of you using free accounts with limited number of skips.

It has support for a lot of media apps (the ones currently supported: Music, TIDAL, Spotify, Anghami, Deezer, Podcasts, SoundCloud, Google Music, YouTube Music).

## Translate NextUp

It was a requested feature to have translations of the "Next Up" label. Refer to the [English translation]([API.md](https://github.com/Nosskirneh/NextUp-Public/blob/master/translations/en.lproj)) within this repo. Copy its folder, change its name to your [country's code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) (see column 639-1) and translate the `Localizable.strings` file. Zip it and send me the zip somehow (email visible from Cydia for example) or open a pull request to this repo.

## Issues

Please include the following when reporting a bug:

1. What app or process isn't working.

Also please make sure the bug isn't caused by another tweak (disable all other just to make sure).
